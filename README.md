# MagicMirror-Tutorial
Source code to go along with the Magic Mirror tutorial project "Learn C# by building an IOT Magic Mirror." 

I emplimented this project using my rasberry pi 5, running MagicMirror locally. 

In addition to the variations I made the modules provided in MagicMirror open-sourse, I had created my own module from scratch.
