# MagicMirror along with my twist!
Source code to go along with the Magic Mirror project.

Quick summary of what magic mirror is: 

A Magic Mirror is a smart mirror that displays digital information like weather, calendar events, news, or notifications while functioning as a regular reflective mirror. Using a two-way mirror, a screen or monitor is placed behind it, projecting information that appears visible on the mirror's surface. (see picture below) 

**In addition to the variations I made to the modules provided in MagicMirror open-source, I had created my own module from scratch.
